Leveraging the component-based philosophy of the React framework, he has outlined the project workspace, breaking down the front-end implementation into discrete components and further refining the page layout hierarchy. This approach decouples individual code contributions, preventing unnecessary conflicts. Moreover, Brian has written the routes for the project, enabling navigation between different pages. This facilitates the addition of more pages and routings, providing a seamless development workflow for future expansions.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  );\n};"],"mappings":";AAAA,OAAOA,MAAM,MAAM,yBAAyB;AAC5C,OAAO,aAAa;AAAC,SAAAC,MAAA,IAAAC,OAAA;AAGrB,eAAe,SAASC,KAAKA,CAAA,EAAG;EAC9B,oBACED,OAAA;IAAAE,QAAA,gBACEF,OAAA;MAAAE,QAAA,eACEF,OAAA,CAACF,MAAM;QAAAK,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAE;IAAC;MAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OACP,CAAC,eACNN,OAAA;MAAKO,SAAS,EAAC,WAAW;MAAAL,QAAA,gBACxBF,OAAA;QAAIO,SAAS,EAAC,UAAU;QAAAL,QAAA,EAAC;MAAK;QAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eACnCN,OAAA;QAAGO,SAAS,EAAC,WAAW;QAAAL,QAAA,EAAC;MAK4B;QAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACzDN,OAAA;QAAGO,SAAS,EAAC,WAAW;QAAAL,QAAA,EAAC;MAIY;QAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACzCN,OAAA;QAAGO,SAAS,EAAC,WAAW;QAAAL,QAAA,EAAC;MAA6a;QAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eAC1cN,OAAA;QAAGO,SAAS,EAAC,WAAW;QAAAL,QAAA,EAAC;MAA6T;QAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eAE1VN,OAAA;QAAIO,SAAS,EAAC,UAAU;QAAAL,QAAA,EAAC;MAAa;QAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eAC3CN,OAAA;QAAGO,SAAS,EAAC,WAAW;QAAAL,QAAA,EAAC;MAI+D;QAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eAE5FN,OAAA;QAAIO,SAAS,EAAC,UAAU;QAAAL,QAAA,EAAC;MAAY;QAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eAC1CN,OAAA;QAAGO,SAAS,EAAC,WAAW;QAAAL,QAAA,EAAC;MAA+mC;QAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eAE5oCN,OAAA;QAAIO,SAAS,EAAC,UAAU;QAAAL,QAAA,EAAC;MAAU;QAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eACxCN,OAAA;QAAGO,SAAS,EAAC,WAAW;QAAAL,QAAA,EAAC;MAAo2B;QAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eAEj4BN,OAAA;QAAIO,SAAS,EAAC,UAAU;QAAAL,QAAA,EAAC;MAAY;QAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eAC1CN,OAAA;QAAGO,SAAS,EAAC,WAAW;QAAAL,QAAA,EAAC;MAA6gC;QAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eAE1iCN,OAAA;QAAIO,SAAS,EAAC,UAAU;QAAAL,QAAA,EAAC;MAAa;QAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eAC3CN,OAAA;QAAGO,SAAS,EAAC,WAAW;QAAAL,QAAA,EAAC;MAAgzB;QAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eAE70BN,OAAA;QAAIO,SAAS,EAAC,UAAU;QAAAL,QAAA,EAAC;MAAc;QAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eAC5CN,OAAA;QAAGO,SAAS,EAAC,WAAW;QAAAL,QAAA,EAAC;MAA8kC;QAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eAE3mCN,OAAA;QAAIO,SAAS,EAAC,UAAU;QAAAL,QAAA,EAAC;MAAiB;QAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eAC/CN,OAAA;QAAGO,SAAS,EAAC,WAAW;QAAAL,QAAA,EAAC;MAA8iC;QAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eAE3kCN,OAAA;QAAIO,SAAS,EAAC,UAAU;QAAAL,QAAA,EAAC;MAAW;QAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eACzCN,OAAA;QAAGO,SAAS,EAAC,WAAW;QAAAL,QAAA,EAAC;MAA+rC;QAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eAE5tCN,OAAA;QAAIO,SAAS,EAAC,UAAU;QAAAL,QAAA,EAAC;MAAS;QAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eACvCN,OAAA;QAAGO,SAAS,EAAC,WAAW;QAAAL,QAAA,EAAC;MAAmqC;QAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAG,CAAC;IAAA;MAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAC7rC,CAAC;EAAA;IAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;IAAAC,UAAA;IAAAC,YAAA;EAAA,OACH,CAAC;AAEV;AAACE,EAAA,GAvDuBP,KAAK;AAuD5B;AAAC,IAAAO,EAAA;AAAAC,YAAA,CAAAD,EAAA","ignoreList":[]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module","externalDependencies":[]}

Initially, he spearheaded the creation of the initial OCR pipeline. To elaborate, he\n            tested and deployed Google's DocumentAI and FormParser for text and table extraction respectfully.\n            After making these processes work locally, he shifted them into a single pipeline function call\n            that would allow this process to work remotely over Google Drive, whereby the 3 storage buckets\n            were created. In addition to the OCR pipeline, he worked with Whitney and Akash in allowing the\n            LLM respond with the sources from which it is pulling the information and link it to the\n            corresponding PDFs. Najib also worked with Ichiro on creating a web scraper that could extract\n            PDFs from web pages and download them locally, saving plenty of time. This webscraper was\n            later expanded by Najib to extract the PDFs from the ISER dataset that was provided by Dhaha.\n            In addition, Najib worked with Ben and Aaron on details with the connector such as Zapier and\n            AirByte and later sat down with Ben and figured out how autonomously extract metadata from PDFs\n            using their corresponding DOI.</p>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n\n\n        <div className=\"flex-container\">\n          <div className=\"flex-img\">\n            <img alt=\"Aaron\" src={aaronPicture} />\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"flex-text\">\n            <h2 className=\"heading2\">Aaron Hong</h2>\n            <p className=\"paragraph\">Aaron is part of the backend team. He was responsible for the design\n            and implementation of the now obsolete Airbyte data pipeline, as well as the decision to use\n            Google Drive as the main form of pipeline cloud storage. He conducted extensive research on\n            ways to automatically transfer data across services and developed an early data pipeline prototype\n            using Airbyte. Using his deployments of Airbyte and Elasticsearch, documents processed by the OCR\n            pipeline were sent to a user endpoint for the first time ever. When the backend design iterated\n            past using Airbyte and Elasticsearch, Aaron worked with the rest of the backend team to refine\n            the new entirely Pythonic data pipeline. In specific, he worked with Najib on his OCR pipeline\n            to refine the JSON output of Google’s DocumentAI, leading to a 99% reduction in JSON file size\n            with negligible loss of information.</p>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n\n        <div className=\"flex-container\">\n          <div className=\"flex-img\">\n            <img alt=\"Akash\" src={akashPicture} />\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"flex-text\">\n            <h2 className=\"heading2\">Akash Shetty</h2>\n            <p className=\"paragraph\">Akash is part of the backend team for the ACEP Captstone team. In his\n            role contributing to the design of ACEP, Akash had the unique opportunity to bridge the realms\n            of both frontend and backend development, for a cohesive user experience. His main accomplishment\n            was spearheading the creation of the actual chatbot, a task that combined the efforts of creating\n            the processed data and creating a RAG model using MILVUS as his vector database, an embedding\n            model from Hugging face, and the underlying LLM using OPENAI gpt-3.5-turbo. Collaborating closely\n            with the backend team, Akash contributed to the robust architecture that underpins the chatbot's\n            functionality, ensuring reliability, scalability, and performance. This holistic approach enabled\n            him to ensure that the chatbot not only meets the immediate needs of users but also integrates\n            smoothly with the backend systems, laying a foundation for future enhancements and features. Throughout\n            the project Akash was able to collaborate and develop with both the front and backend team.</p>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n\n        <div className=\"flex-container\">\n          <div className=\"flex-img\">\n            <img alt=\"Ichiro\" src={ichiroPicture} />\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"flex-text\">\n            <h2 className=\"heading2\">Ichiro (Gerald) Nakata</h2>\n            <p className=\"paragraph\">Ichiro is the project manager for the ACEP Capstone team.

All biweekly reports were also his responsibility, alongside\n            setting up documents for the weekly individual and group reports for the faculty/TA meetings.\n            Additionally, he contributed to the start of the backend PDF pipeline with a web scraper that\n            was used to pull PDFs from websites. The scraper pulls the HTML and parses through the REGEX to\n            find all of the links to documents and subsequently downloads them.</p>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n\n        <div className=\"flex-container\">\n          <div className=\"flex-img\">\n            <img alt=\"Benjamin\" src={benjaminPicture} />\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"flex-text\">\n            <h2 className=\"heading2\">Benjamin Jiang</h2>\n            <p className=\"paragraph\">Benjamin is part of the backend team, notably in data management and\n            processing. His contributions include advocating for the adoption of Google Drive for its\n            cost-effectiveness and flexibility, enhancing data manipulation methods, and recommending\n            Amazon Textract for superior table parsing performance over Google Form Parser. He spearheaded\n            the design and implementation of a data pipeline that facilitated seamless data transfers\n            between cloud storage and Elasticsearch, incorporating research into solutions like Meltano,\n            Airbyte, and Zapier for effective data integration. With the shift towards using a vector\n            database, now the effort has been transferred to calling Milvus api using python code. Furthermore,\n            in collaboration with team members Nijib and Aaron, he improved metadata acquisition and refined\n            JSON outputs from Document AI OCR, contributing to the quality of document processing. Currently,\n            he's focused on refining Python-based data pipelines alongside the backend team, aiming to bolster\n            our data processing capabilities and ensure the scalability of our backend infrastructure. </p>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n\n        <div className=\"flex-container\">\n          <div className=\"flex-img\">\n            <img alt=\"Whitney\" src={whitneyPicture} />\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"flex-text\">\n            <h2 className=\"heading2\">Whitney Waldinger</h2>\n            <p className=\"paragraph\">Whitney is the communication manager for the ACEP Capstone team.

This included helping to schedule weekly\n            meetings and reserving meeting locations. She also acted as the project manager for the frontend\n            team. She helped to create, design, code, and improve the UI. She worked with Dhaha and iterated\n            through various different designs for the frontend. At first, she implemented an App Search\n            utilizing Elasticsearch. She created a Search Engine in the Elastic Cloud to do so. This UI\n            allowed the users to filter the search results and returned a list of all documents fitting\n            the criteria. Then, once the team chose to focus on a Chatbot integration rather than search\n            engine, she helped to alter Akash’s chatbot UI to fit the design guidelines set by Dhaha. She\n            also worked with Najib and Akash to incorporate not only the summarized answer but also the\n            data sources, with links, under each response from the LLM.</p>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n\n        <div className=\"flex-container\">\n          <div className=\"flex-img\">\n            <img alt=\"Joni\" src={joniPicture} />\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"flex-text\">\n            <h2 className=\"heading2\">Joni Nguyen</h2>\n            <p className=\"paragraph\">Joni is the budget manager for the ACEP Capstone team.

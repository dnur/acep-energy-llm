Concurrently, Brian\n        collaborated with Whitney and Joni to discuss and design the webpage’s layouts, styles, and\n        distribution of pages, as per Daha's specifications. Based on these requirements, Brian has\n        programmed the CSS styles for several components and improved the functionality of the search bar\n        and chat box. Importantly, Brian also manages the codebase and architecture of the front-end project.\n        Leveraging the component-based philosophy of the React framework, he has outlined the project workspace,\n        breaking down the front-end implementation into discrete components and further refining the page layout\n        hierarchy. This approach decouples individual code contributions, preventing unnecessary conflicts. Moreover,\n        Brian has written the routes for the project, enabling navigation between different pages. This facilitates\n        the addition of more pages and routings, providing a seamless development workflow for future expansions.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  );\n};"],"mappings":";AAAA,OAAOA,MAAM,MAAM,yBAAyB;AAC5C,OAAO,aAAa;AAAC,SAAAC,MAAA,IAAAC,OAAA;AAGrB,eAAe,SAASC,KAAKA,CAAA,EAAG;EAC9B,oBACED,OAAA;IAAAE,QAAA,gBACEF,OAAA;MAAAE,QAAA,eACEF,OAAA,CAACF,MAAM;QAAAK,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAE;IAAC;MAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OACP,CAAC,eACNN,OAAA;MAAKO,SAAS,EAAC,WAAW;MAAAL,QAAA,gBACxBF,OAAA;QAAIO,SAAS,EAAC,UAAU;QAAAL,QAAA,EAAC;MAAK;QAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eACnCN,OAAA;QAAGO,SAAS,EAAC,WAAW;QAAAL,QAAA,EAAC;MAK4B;QAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACzDN,OAAA;QAAGO,SAAS,EAAC,WAAW;QAAAL,QAAA,EAAC;MAIY;QAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACzCN,OAAA;QAAGO,SAAS,EAAC,WAAW;QAAAL,QAAA,EAAC;MAImC;QAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eAChEN,OAAA;QAAGO,SAAS,EAAC,WAAW;QAAAL,QAAA,EAAC;MAGyB;QAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eAEtDN,OAAA;QAAIO,SAAS,EAAC,UAAU;QAAAL,QAAA,EAAC;MAAa;QAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eAC3CN,OAAA;QAAGO,SAAS,EAAC,WAAW;QAAAL,QAAA,EAAC;MAEoD;QAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eAEjFN,OAAA;QAAIO,SAAS,EAAC,UAAU;QAAAL,QAAA,EAAC;MAAY;QAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eAC1CN,OAAA;QAAGO,SAAS,EAAC,WAAW;QAAAL,QAAA,EAAC;MAYK;QAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eAElCN,OAAA;QAAIO,SAAS,EAAC,UAAU;QAAAL,QAAA,EAAC;MAAU;QAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eACxCN,OAAA;QAAGO,SAAS,EAAC,WAAW;QAAAL,QAAA,EAAC;MASW;QAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eAExCN,OAAA;QAAIO,SAAS,EAAC,UAAU;QAAAL,QAAA,EAAC;MAAY;QAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eAC1CN,OAAA;QAAGO,SAAS,EAAC,WAAW;QAAAL,QAAA,EAAC;MAUkE;QAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eAE/FN,OAAA;QAAIO,SAAS,EAAC,UAAU;QAAAL,QAAA,EAAC;MAAa;QAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eAC3CN,OAAA;QAAGO,SAAS,EAAC,WAAW;QAAAL,QAAA,EAAC;MAQ0C;QAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eAEvEN,OAAA;QAAIO,SAAS,EAAC,UAAU;QAAAL,QAAA,EAAC;MAAc;QAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eAC5CN,OAAA;QAAGO,SAAS,EAAC,WAAW;QAAAL,QAAA,EAAC;MAWkE;QAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eAE/FN,OAAA;QAAIO,SAAS,EAAC,UAAU;QAAAL,QAAA,EAAC;MAAiB;QAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eAC/CN,OAAA;QAAGO,SAAS,EAAC,WAAW;QAAAL,QAAA,EAAC;MAWkC;QAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eAE/DN,OAAA;QAAIO,SAAS,EAAC,UAAU;QAAAL,QAAA,EAAC;MAAW;QAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eACzCN,OAAA;QAAGO,SAAS,EAAC,WAAW;QAAAL,QAAA,EAAC;MAYE;QAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eAE/BN,OAAA;QAAIO,SAAS,EAAC,UAAU;QAAAL,QAAA,EAAC;MAAS;QAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eACvCN,OAAA;QAAGO,SAAS,EAAC,WAAW;QAAAL,QAAA,EAAC;MAWgF;QAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAG,CAAC;IAAA;MAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAC1G,CAAC;EAAA;IAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;IAAAC,UAAA;IAAAC,YAAA;EAAA,OACH,CAAC;AAEV;AAACE,EAAA,GAhJuBP,KAAK;AAgJ5B;AAAC,IAAAO,EAAA;AAAAC,YAAA,CAAAD,EAAA","ignoreList":[]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module","externalDependencies":[]}

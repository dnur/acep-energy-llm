                Najib is part of the backend team and has had a part in all aspects
                of it. Initially, he spearheaded the creation of the initial OCR pipeline. To elaborate, he
                tested and deployed Google's DocumentAI and FormParser for text and table extraction respectfully.
                After making these processes work locally, he shifted them into a single pipeline function call
                that would allow this process to work remotely over Google Drive, whereby the 3 storage buckets
                were created. In addition to the OCR pipeline, he worked with Whitney and Akash in allowing the
                LLM respond with the sources from which it is pulling the information and link it to the
                corresponding PDFs. Najib also worked with Ichiro on creating a web scraper that could extract
                PDFs from web pages and download them locally, saving plenty of time. This webscraper was
                later expanded by Najib to extract the PDFs from the ISER dataset that was provided by Dhaha.
                In addition, Najib worked with Ben and Aaron on details with the connector such as Zapier and
                AirByte and later sat down with Ben and figured out how autonomously extract metadata from PDFs
                using their corresponding DOI.

                Aaron is part of the backend team. He was responsible for the design
                and implementation of the now obsolete Airbyte data pipeline, as well as the decision to use
                Google Drive as the main form of pipeline cloud storage. He conducted extensive research on
                ways to automatically transfer data across services and developed an early data pipeline prototype
                using Airbyte. Using his deployments of Airbyte and Elasticsearch, documents processed by the OCR
                pipeline were sent to a user endpoint for the first time ever. When the backend design iterated
                past using Airbyte and Elasticsearch, Aaron worked with the rest of the backend team to refine
                the new entirely Pythonic data pipeline. In specific, he worked with Najib on his OCR pipeline
                to refine the JSON output of Googleâ€™s DocumentAI, leading to a 99% reduction in JSON file size
                with negligible loss of information.

                Akash is part of the backend team for the ACEP Captstone team. In his
                role contributing to the design of ACEP, Akash had the unique opportunity to bridge the realms
                of both frontend and backend development, for a cohesive user experience. His main accomplishment
                was spearheading the creation of the actual chatbot, a task that combined the efforts of creating
                the processed data and creating a RAG model using MILVUS as his vector database, an embedding
                model from Hugging face, and the underlying LLM using OPENAI gpt-3.5-turbo. Collaborating closely
                with the backend team, Akash contributed to the robust architecture that underpins the chatbot's
                functionality, ensuring reliability, scalability, and performance. This holistic approach enabled
                him to ensure that the chatbot not only meets the immediate needs of users but also integrates
                smoothly with the backend systems, laying a foundation for future enhancements and features. Throughout
                the project Akash was able to collaborate and develop with both the front and backend team.

                processing. His contributions include advocating for the adoption of Google Drive for its
                cost-effectiveness and flexibility, enhancing data manipulation methods, and recommending
                Amazon Textract for superior table parsing performance over Google Form Parser. He spearheaded
                the design and implementation of a data pipeline that facilitated seamless data transfers
                between cloud storage and Elasticsearch, incorporating research into solutions like Meltano,
                Airbyte, and Zapier for effective data integration. With the shift towards using a vector
                database, now the effort has been transferred to calling Milvus api using python code. Furthermore,
                in collaboration with team members Nijib and Aaron, he improved metadata acquisition and refined
                JSON outputs from Document AI OCR, contributing to the quality of document processing. Currently,

                Nur (Industry Mentor) and the rest of the capstone team. This included helping to schedule weekly
                meetings and reserving meeting locations. She also acted as the project manager for the frontend
                team. She helped to create, design, code, and improve the UI. She worked with Dhaha and iterated
                through various different designs for the frontend. At first, she implemented an App Search
                utilizing Elasticsearch. She created a Search Engine in the Elastic Cloud to do so. This UI
                allowed the users to filter the search results and returned a list of all documents fitting
                the criteria. Then, once the team chose to focus on a Chatbot integration rather than search
                engine, she helped to alter Akashâ€™s chatbot UI to fit the design guidelines set by Dhaha. She
                also worked with Najib and Akash to incorporate not only the summarized answer but also the
                data sources, with links, under each response from the LLM.

                Brian is part of the frontend team for the ACEP Capstone team, primarily
                responsible for the implementation of the static websites. In the development process, he utilized
                the React.js framework to write robust code for various components and pages. Concurrently, Brian
                collaborated with Whitney and Joni to discuss and design the webpageâ€™s layouts, styles, and
                distribution of pages, as per Daha's specifications. Based on these requirements, Brian has
                programmed the CSS styles for several components and improved the functionality of the search bar
                and chat box. Importantly, Brian also manages the codebase and architecture of the front-end project.
                Leveraging the component-based philosophy of the React framework, he has outlined the project workspace,
                breaking down the front-end implementation into discrete components and further refining the page layout
                hierarchy. This approach decouples individual code contributions, preventing unnecessary conflicts, providing a seamless development workflow for future expansions.

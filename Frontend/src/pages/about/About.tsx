            <p className="paragraph">Najib is part of the backend team and has had a part in all aspects
            of it. Initially, he spearheaded the creation of the initial OCR pipeline. To elaborate, he
            tested and deployed Google's DocumentAI and FormParser for text and table extraction respectfully.
            After making these processes work locally, he shifted them into a single pipeline function call
            that would allow this process to work remotely over Google Drive, whereby the 3 storage buckets
            were created. In addition to the OCR pipeline, he worked with Whitney and Akash in allowing the
            LLM respond with the sources from which it is pulling the information and link it to the
            corresponding PDFs. Najib also worked with Ichiro on creating a web scraper that could extract
            PDFs from web pages and download them locally, saving plenty of time. This webscraper was
            later expanded by Najib to extract the PDFs from the ISER dataset that was provided by Dhaha.
            In addition, Najib worked with Ben and Aaron on details with the connector such as Zapier and
            AirByte and later sat down with Ben and figured out how autonomously extract metadata from PDFs
            using their corresponding DOI.</p>

            <h2 className="heading2">Aaron Hong</h2>
            <p className="paragraph">Aaron is part of the backend team. He was responsible for the design
            and implementation of the now obsolete Airbyte data pipeline, as well as the decision to use
            Google Drive as the main form of pipeline cloud storage. He conducted extensive research on
            ways to automatically transfer data across services and developed an early data pipeline prototype
            using Airbyte. Using his deployments of Airbyte and Elasticsearch, documents processed by the OCR
            pipeline were sent to a user endpoint for the first time ever. When the backend design iterated
            past using Airbyte and Elasticsearch, Aaron worked with the rest of the backend team to refine
            the new entirely Pythonic data pipeline. In specific, he worked with Najib on his OCR pipeline
            to refine the JSON output of Googleâ€™s DocumentAI, leading to a 99% reduction in JSON file size
            with negligible loss of information.</p>

            <p className="paragraph">Akash is part of the backend team for the ACEP Captstone team. In his
            role contributing to the design of ACEP, Akash had the unique opportunity to bridge the realms
            of both frontend and backend development, for a cohesive user experience. His main accomplishment
            was spearheading the creation of the actual chatbot, a task that combined the efforts of creating
            the processed data and creating a RAG model using MILVUS as his vector database, an embedding
            model from Hugging face, and the underlying LLM using OPENAI gpt-3.5-turbo. Collaborating closely
            with the backend team, Akash contributed to the robust architecture that underpins the chatbot's
            functionality, ensuring reliability, scalability, and performance. This holistic approach enabled
            him to ensure that the chatbot not only meets the immediate needs of users but also integrates
            smoothly with the backend systems, laying a foundation for future enhancements and features. Throughout
            the project Akash was able to collaborate and develop with both the front and backend team.</p>

            handled the communication between Rose Johnson (TA), Rajesh Subramayan (Faculty Mentor), Dhaha
            Nur (Industry Mentor) and the rest of the capstone team. This included helping to schedule weekly
            meetings and reserving meeting locations. She also acted as the project manager for the frontend
            team. She helped to create, design, code, and improve the UI. She worked with Dhaha and iterated
            through various different designs for the frontend. At first, she implemented an App Search
            utilizing Elasticsearch. She created a Search Engine in the Elastic Cloud to do so. This UI
            allowed the users to filter the search results and returned a list of all documents fitting
            the criteria. Then, once the team chose to focus on a Chatbot integration rather than search
            engine, she helped to alter Akashâ€™s chatbot UI to fit the design guidelines set by Dhaha. She
            also worked with Najib and Akash to incorporate not only the summarized answer but also the
            data sources, with links, under each response from the LLM.</p>
